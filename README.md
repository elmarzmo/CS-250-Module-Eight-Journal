How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To interpret user needs and implement them into a program, it's crucial to engage in active communication and collaboration with stakeholders. User stories play a pivotal role in this process by providing a structured framework for understanding user requirements from their perspective. By crafting user stories, we articulate the specific needs, desires, and pain points of end-users in an understandable manner.
This approach helps prioritize features and functionalities based on their significance to users, ensuring that the resulting program aligns closely with their expectations.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

In approaching program development, I aim to adopt agile processes that promote flexibility, adaptability, and iterative development. Agile methodologies such as Scrum enable teams to respond effectively to changing requirements and deliver value incrementally. By breaking down the development process into manageable iterations or sprints, we can continuously gather feedback, iterate on designs, and deliver working software at regular intervals. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development involves several key qualities and practices. Firstly, effective communication is essential for sharing ideas, clarifying requirements, and resolving conflicts constructively. Actively listening to teammates and stakeholders fosters a culture of collaboration and mutual respect. Additionally, being adaptable and willing to embrace change is crucial in dynamic development environments. This entails being open to feedback, iterating on solutions, and continuously improving processes.
